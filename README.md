<h1>Christmas D-Day calendar</h1>

I made a Christmas D-Day calendar through an online lecture at Spartan Coding Club.(It used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.)ðŸ˜š

When you click on the box, the modal box appears as the box rotates, and it was interesting that the box rotation effect could be applied only with css, not javascript.
It was also interesting that the effect of snow on the background was also an effect made using only css.

And at the bottom of the page, there is a button to play a song. It was interesting because it was my first time inserting a song into a web page.ðŸ¥°ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽµ
